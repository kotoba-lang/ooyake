  "1:1 port of cells/world_model/cell.py — ooyake cross-actor WORLD-MODEL reconcile
  (ADR-2606021600 §3, depends ADR-2606011000 engi-organism-ontology + ADR-2606011800 tsumugi).

  This is the missing LAYER that joins the two government-facing graphs into one
  world model on the SHARED id-space:

      ooyake :gov.unit/*   (STRUCTURE — who/where/how of public administration)
         ── :gov.unit/organism ──▶  tsumugi :organism/*   (KARMA — 縁/取 power-graph)

  Until now `:gov.unit/organism` was defined in the ontology but populated by no
  unit and joined by no code: ooyake catalogued structure, tsumugi wove karma, and
  nothing reconciled the SAME public body across both. This cell performs that
  reconcile, OFFLINE and deterministically, and emits a world-model artifact.

  Charter shape (read-side, the same discipline as cells/reconcile/cell.py):
    - G9 READ-SIDE — produces a *report* + a *proposed* world-model artifact under
      out/. It NEVER mutates a committed seed; applying a proposed link is a
      separate operator-gated step.
    - G1 POWER-ONLY (tsumugi §D8/§D9) — only power-bearing units (country /
      supranational / cabinet / ministry / agency / bureau / legislature / court)
      are reconciled into the karma graph. Local service surface (prefecture /
      municipality / ward / division / 窓口) is civic-wayfinding, NOT a
      取-concentration node, and is EXCLUDED by construction — never a target-list.
    - G5 SOURCING-HONESTY — confirmed links require an explicit :gov.unit/organism
      whose target organism exists; everything else is a *proposal* tagged
      :representative / :latent. No fabricated reconciliation.
    - mode='live' RAISES (planet-scale ingest + write-back is Council + operator
      gated, exactly like reconcile.py).

  Two graphs in, one world model out. Stdlib only, no network, no LLM."
